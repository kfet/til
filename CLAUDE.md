# CLAUDE.md for TIL Repository

## Repository Structure
- Topic-specific directories (aws, git, shell, etc.)
- Individual TIL entries as Markdown files within topic directories

## Markdown Formatting Conventions
- Use descriptive filenames in lowercase with underscores (e.g., `git_configure.md`)
- Start each file with a level 1 or level 2 heading describing the topic
- Use code blocks with backticks (```) for commands and code snippets
- Specify language for syntax highlighting where applicable
- Keep entries concise and focused on a single topic

## File Organization
- Group related TILs in topic-specific directories
- Name files descriptively to indicate their content
- Follow the pattern: `topic/specific_knowledge.md`

## Content Guidelines
- Focus on practical, actionable information
- Include command examples where applicable
- Explain the context or problem being solved
- Keep entries brief but complete enough to be useful
- Link to external references when appropriate using [text](URL) format
